# Keep-Coding-Initiative
Place to safe and share my learning projects in C for the Keep-Coding-Initiative Berlin.

All the programs here that I have written myself are just for learning how to find solutions and writing code in C. 
The tasks or solutions are not original. They are inspired by tasks in the following books or platforms:

1.)
Kernighan, Brian W./ Ritchie M. Dennis: The C Programming Language, 2nd edition, 1988 (Prentice Hall Software Series).
